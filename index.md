Griefing is forbidden! The server has no privates, but there is a system for recording any changes blocks, so as to track unwanted actions.

To play on the server is required to apply to play on our server [Discord](). 

Our project is completely OpenSource, the source code of which is uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/MVSPlus/)


Notes:
