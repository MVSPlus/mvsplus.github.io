### About:

What is "MVS+"? This is a Minecraft server for version 1.19. The restart of the beloved project "MVS" (MinecraftVanillaSurvival).

This server has mods, without which you can fully enter and play both with Java and Bedrock¹. If you want additional game features you can install our [modpack](/en/modpack).
The server works on the system of RolePlay + Survival. This means that you can survive as a normal player, and also can create their own settlements, clans, shops².

Griefing is forbidden! The server has no privates, but there is a system for recording any changes blocks, so as to track unwanted actions.

To play on the server is required to apply to play on our server [Discord](). 

Our project is completely OpenSource, the source code of which is uploaded to [GitHub](https://github.com/MVSPlus)


Notes:
- ¹ - Cross-play features with Bedrock is implemented with the [Geyser](https://geysermc.org) plugin. There may be bugs!
- ² - No plugins/mods are used to create settlements.
